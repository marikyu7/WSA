WSA - WindowSizeAnalysis

### Abstract
Synchronization is a collective coherent response observed in various physical, biological, and social systems; thus, understanding the reliability of synchronization measures is crucial for studying social and psychological dynamics. This paper investigates the impact of window size on synchrony measures and evaluates their reliability. In particular, three synchronization metrics, symbolic entropy, cluster-phase "Rho" metric, and sum-normalized cross-spectral density (CSD), are considered, and bootstrapping is proposed to estimate confidence intervals (CI) for each metric. 
The study demonstrates that smaller window sizes enhance synchronization detection precision, even in the presence of moderate noise. Overall, the Rho metric shows better performances in estimating measures for noisy synthetic signals. However, the results also show that metric performance is found to be context-dependent.
